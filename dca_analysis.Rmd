### Disney California Wait Time dataset from [Tivory21](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tivory27/disney-california-adventure-wait-times) on Kaggle.

## Hypothetical Scenario
Walt Disney Imagineering are planning to build a new attraction in the Disney California Adventure park. To ease congestion and balance wait times for other attractions throughout the park, they want to place the new ride in a low-foot traffic area. As a Junior Data Analyst, I will analyse the wait time data for the current attractions throughout the park and present my recommendations for the new ride location in this report. 

## Assumptions
* The dataset includes data from 2024-07-08 to 2025-06-11 inclusively. For a real report, I would ideally have a wider range of dates. 
* Rides that are open seasonally will be ignored. (maybe)


## Tools Used
* Microsoft Excel
* R in RStudio
* Tableau

## Business Task
Recommend several best-suited locations within Disney California Adventure park for a new attraction. The new location should improve guest flow by being near rides with low wait times in less-visited areas of the park. 

## Import the Data
```{r import}
wait_times <- read.csv("disney_wait_times.csv")
```

## Clean the Data
* Use clean_names function from the janitor package to clean the column names.
```{r clean_names}
clean_wait_times <- clean_names(wait_times)
```
* Use dplyr package to change the data type of the local_time column to datetime.
```{r time}
clean_wait_times <- clean_wait_times %>%
  mutate(local_time = with_tz(ymd_hms(local_time, tz = "UTC"), "America/Los_Angeles"))
```



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
